# Zeno’s paradox, countability, uncountability and the continuum hypothesis

S.K.Venkatesan

### Abstract

We show here that just like the resolution of Zeno’s paradox, contradiction between countability and uncountability can be resolved. Here it is shown that contradictions don’t exist in an ideal world, and that they
only arise due to elements in physical reality that challenge idealism. Contradictions gives rise to infinite hierarchies of classes and that these classes are distinguished better by scaling dimensions (Hausdorff measures), providing a new way to look at continuum hypothesis. We also show that the quantitative aspects of the problem of algorithmic complexity classes throws further light on these contradictions.

“Reason has always existed, but not always in a reasonable form” – Karl Marx


Contradictions are mills through which reality ebbs and flows. The right and left hand side exists as opposing manifestations. The fact that the
perfect symmetry of the left and right is broken is what establishes their distinction. If Earth is a perfect sphere, then there would not be rivers
and valleys that brings life to it. However, since the radius of the earth is almost a constant (to more than an accuracy of 99%), we are qualified to call it a sphere.

Contradictions are also a great source of changes to society and transitions from one form to another. Goliath was powerful when combat was direct physical conflict with hand-held weapons. When the giant Goliath calls David to come near him to fight him it is clear that only at that range that he can overcome David. David at the same time keeps his distance to deny him that opportunity and defeats him with his long-distance weapon. Inside the atomic nucleus such a conflict between the Goliath nuclear forces that operate only short distances release enormous amount of energy when it comes in conflict with the electrical repulsion
that operates at long distances as the size of the nucleus becomes sufficiently large, as in the case of Uranium or Plutonium nucleus. At the
other end of the spectrum when the gravitational forces crushes electrical repulsion in Hydrogen ions, the Goliath nuclear forces take over releasing
enormous energy producing the energy of the sun. 

In this article we first consider classical Zeno’s paradox, countable infinity and uncountable infinities of higher order. We also show how
these Hegelian contradictions lead to an hierarchy of infinities. We then show that the so called uncountable numbers can in fact be counted as
well, using a close parallel with Zeno’s paradox, resulting in a serious fissure in continuum hypothesis and Gödel’s incompleteness theorem as well.

## Classical Hegelian hierarchy of infinities

We will begin with the classical Zeno’s paradox that is usually explained in terms of Achilles and the tortoise [Aristotle, 350 BCE].

### Zeno’s paradox

Classical Zeno’s paradox is illustrated by the story of the Achilles and the Tortoise. The paradox follows from the argument that if the tortoise
takes a lead, then each time Achilles reaches the place the tortoise was, the tortoise would have moved further away, and however fast the Achilles
chases the tortoise, it can never catch the tortoise, as each time the tortoise would have moved further away while Achilles is trying to catchup. We
will illustrate this in a much simpler way using the concept of recursive decimals:

0.99999 ··· = 1

We know from this that there are infinite sequence of numbers, 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ... that are bound above by the finite value 1.0. The finite
value 1.0 can be expressed by the infinite sequence of decimals represented by the above equation. Of course, there are many such infinite sequences
that approach 1.0, each with its own rhyme and rhythm. The fact that the infinite is contained in the finite value of 1.0 is indeed a paradox.
However, it depends on how we measure the bananas, by counting them or by weighing them. Although it takes infinite steps in an algorithm for
the Achilles in terms of number of zero-dimensional points, it is still finite in terms of length of time it takes for it to reach the tortoise. The paradox disappears once we weigh the bananas instead of counting them.

### Hegelian hierarchy of infinities in classical mathematics

Let us now consider the cardinality of a set as the number of elements in a set, for example, if

A = {dog, cat, horse, car, bus, train, aeroplane}

#(A) = 7

Now consider the set of all subsets of A, symbolically written as the set,
2^A and in fact this notation for the power-set is justified by the relation,

#(2^A) = 2^#(A)
