# Zeno’s paradox, countability, uncountability and the continuum hypothesis

S.K.Venkatesan

### Abstract

We show here that just like the resolution of Zeno’s paradox, contradiction between countability and uncountability can be resolved. Here it is shown that contradictions don’t exist in an ideal world, and that they
only arise due to elements in physical reality that challenge idealism. Contradictions gives rise to infinite hierarchies of classes and that these classes are distinguished better by scaling dimensions (Hausdorff measures), providing a new way to look at continuum hypothesis. We also show that the quantitative aspects of the problem of algorithmic complexity classes throws further light on these contradictions.
